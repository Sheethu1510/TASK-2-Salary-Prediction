## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts an individual's salary based on their demographic and professional attributes. Using a dataset sourced from Kaggle, the model considers factors such as age, education level, job title, experience, race, and country. The goal is to uncover patterns in salary distribution and explore potential disparities or trends across diverse population groups.

##  About the Dataset

The dataset consists of **6704 rows** and **9 columns**, and a target variable â€” **Salary**. It contains detailed information about individuals' backgrounds and earnings, making it suitable for analyzing income inequality and the influence of professional experience on salary levels.

Demographic variables such as **education**, **race**, **gender**, and **country** help paint a broader picture of income trends across different population segments. A particularly valuable feature is **Years of Experience**, which offers insight into how salary evolves with career progression.
